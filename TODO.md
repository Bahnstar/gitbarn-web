# TO DO
- [ ] Add a page to manage/send mass emails for admins

- [ ] Connect the profile page to supabase
- [ ] Integrate pulling customer data from Tiger on sign-up
- [ ] Allow support to open a new chat with a specific user
- [ ] Order details page
- [ ] Order page should implement proper filtering
- [ ] Move products to use Tiger instead of supabase
- [ ] Allow support users to claim a chat

- [ ] Login button on the home page on mobile needs to be visible

# For future investigation
- Additional analytics
- A map with latitude/longitude for orders on the dashboard
- Refactor the close conversation/document upload buttons to be a single unified component

- File previews for documents
